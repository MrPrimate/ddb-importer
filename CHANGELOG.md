# 2.9.39

* Item munch did not always add max dex to armors due to data change.
* When using "experimental attempt to use items instead of setting flat AC" Rings of Protection were not detected. Hide armor is now also detected.

# 2.9.36

* Scale Value generation was broken by previous update.

* Clerics with customised spell names would duplicate the spell, marking one as unprepared.

In my testing it targets 503 monsters. This should target most basic varieties of these saves, for example Poison on Drow crossbow. It won't do the fancier elements right now, or things whch might require a macro. It will try and create Overtime effects for sustained damage, e.g. Flumph tentacles.

# 2.9.30

* Better handling of non-english SRD.
* Initial work on support for some features hopefully coming in D&D v1.6.0
* Monsters: Monster features/attacks like the Giant Spiders Bite which have a secondary damage vs save effect will now attempt to put this damage into the versatile field, as per SRD style. This also allows for midi-qol to use and automate this save and damage.
* Monsters: some tweaks for Netherdeep monster parsing.

# 2.9.16

* Character Updates: Exhaustion updates could be inconsistent.
* Character Import: When ignoring bio the ideals would still be imported.

# 2.9.10

* Fix fo `fixCritters` function if import screen was not open.
* Try and improve weird errors importing monsters.
* Monsters parsing: some features with recharge (e.g. Giant Spiders web) could come in as weapons, which don't support recharge. @callbritton#5405
* Character: Customised Actions will now carry over attack and damage bonuses. This resulted in a rewrite of the core functionality here so please let me know if anything looks off/broken for items or spells. @Icoshi#2431

# 2.9.9

* Items would duplicate/nest condition links to SRD conditions.
* Fly speed would not parse on Fairy.
* Some items would not generate speed effects, e.g. Broomstick
* If you have actors in DDB Monsters compendium that were not created outside of DDB but you now wish to link, you can use `DDBImporter.fixCritters()` from a macro or within the browser developer console to add the DDB Id to any matching actors (by name). This is necessary as recently the Importer started checking for a name and the DDB id in order to support multiple actors with the same name in the compendium.

# 2.9.8

* Adventure Uploads using S3 bucket failed.
* Keep "GM Notes"(module) on character imports.

# 2.9.7

* Using artificer extras without artificer levels could cause import of extras to fail.
* A number of icon additions to the icon sets.

* Monster muncher will now use the default token settings as it's base value for token settings.


# 2.9.2

* Remove flags from compendium loaded options which retain resource consumption, ignore the item or icon. These would confuse the muncher if they had been set in on the feature before added to the Override compendium.
* A v8 import bug if DAE was not enabled @BlitheRapier888#1464

# 2.9.1

* Adventure Muncher would sometimes try and convert svgs to webp. It should no longer do this.

# 2.9.0

* [Experimental] New setting in core settings to enable webp mode. This will convert all images when loaded through muncher or characters into webp files. What is webp? It's a image storage format that makes images very small. Note if you turn this on and update monsters/spells/items/etc it won't remove the old images - you'll have to do that manually. Consider changing the upload directories for images both for characters and adventures if you wish to migrate stuff to save space.
* When choosing to hide the display dialogue setting for character resource manager, it would not always update the resources @kid2407 / Tobias#6450

# 2.7.3

* Resource Selector - new dialog will pop up asking about what Resources you wish to use. This is the first part of improving resource management.
* Improved messages about selected sources.
* Monster munch: tiny and small creatures had scale values different to SRD monsters. The grid size and scale now reflects SRD compendium.

# 2.7.2

* Monster munch: armor items will now be added to a monsters equipment.
* Monster munch: In the case of natural armor, this will now be set as such in the ac calculation field.
* Monster munch: experimental feature: attempt to set AC based on armor items. This works for most monsters. There are oddities for monsters with abilities or magic items, or just incorrect AC calcuations (Arkhan looking at you), it _should_ try to set it to a flat value where I have been able to detect this. Please report any _bad monsters_.

Item effects generated:
* Armoured AC bonuses
* Unarmoured AC and bonuses
* Saving throw bonuses
* Ability Check bonuses and advantage on saves and checks
* Skill check bonuses and advantage on saves and checks
* Ability bonuses
* Proficiency bonuses
* Ability score over-rides (e.g. belt of x strength)
* Spell attack and DC bonuses
* Damage Resistance, Immunity and Vulnerabilities
* Condition immunities
* Languages
* Darkvision, blindsight base and bonuses
* Speed/movement
* Proficiencies
* HP per level
* Skill bonuses
* Advantage on skill checks
* Advantage on initiative
* Advantage on saves vs magical attacks
* AC base effects on armor items

Character, racial traits, and background effects generated:
* AC base effects on character features
* Same as item effects, except several features don't get a feature in foundry (e.g. Ability increases).

Notes:
* When importing characters and auto generating effects, the import will be significantly slower due to some race conditions around effect generation when updating characters.
* Some effects may not come through for some items, these tend to be ones with very specific advantages, e.g. Advantage on Persuasion vs Giants and the like. There exceptions such as the Cloak of Elvenkind, or resistances where you should be holding the item.
* It adds only a limited number of more specialist effects.
* You can use this in combination with Copy Effects for DAE SRD.
* Active Effect generation does not work in the Muncher for the experimental features such as feat, class and racial trait parsing.

Other Improvements:
* Icons don't use absolute paths
* Artificer Battle Smith will now use Int for magic weapon attacks
* Attacks now add damage type hints where possible
* If DAE is installed it will be used to generate skill bonuses rather than 5e skill customisation module
* If using the MagicItems module, spells will try to be found in the DDB Spells compendium -> SRD Compendium and only creating them n the world as a last resort if it can't find the spell allready.
* You can generate a set of Character Effects for each of your equipped AC options. This is similar to the DAE Auto Generate AC option, however, these will over-ride DAE and effects applied by equipping items. AC is quite hard to calculate dynamically in Foundry in edge cases as it requires users to active the correct set of effects that apply. Not all effects (e.g. from class features) are currently generated.
* Pressing enter in the monster search field no longer reloads the page.
* Homebrew monster parsing improvements.
* A handful of monsters had some odd formatting for their special traits which broke special trait and spell parsing. ["Hlam", "Ygorl, Lord of Entropy", "Whymsee (Kraken Priest Variant)", "Strahd Zombie", "Skr’a S’orsk", "Mongrelfolk", "Laeral Silverhand", "Jarlaxle Baenre", "Gar Shatterkeel (Noncore)", "Forlarren", "Fog Giant", "Fhenimore (Kraken Priest Variant)", "Drow Arachnomancer", "Archon of the Triumvirate", "Amble"].
* Cones and Line area effects were the wrong way around in monster parsing due to late night coding.
* For monster abilities that have a recharge function (e.g Hell Hounds breath) this now does the correct resource linking for the recharge.
* Bio updates are now optional during character update.
* Monster munch: improved parsing for a handful of monsters where special actions did not parse properly, e.g. Obzedat Ghost.
* Monster munch: improved parsing for monsters with tables e.g. variant troll.
* Monster munch: some monsters had their Roleplaying descriptions defined as actions, these now parse into the character biography. e.g. Augrek Brighthelm.
* Monster munch: some monsters like Worvil “the Weevil” Forkbeard had action names for items that duplicated.
* Background now imports as a feature.
* Support for grabbing the Cobalt Cookie using https://github.com/IamWarHead/ddb-data-grabber
